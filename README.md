# Sorting Hat

With this project we were tasked to build a Harry Potter sorting hat application to test our skills with Bootstrap v4.x

## Technical Requirements

- You must use Boostrap 4 to style your page components.
- You should apply responsive design to your page (aka your app should be designed to work on small screens)
- Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function
- Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentations

## Optional Bonus

- Helpful Form: An error message shows if a user tries to sort a student without filling out the form.
- House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
- Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
- Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.
